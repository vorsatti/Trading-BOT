## Trading BOT

This project is a trading BOT connected to my OANDA demo account and successively deployed to an instance in AWS cloud .

There are two BOTs:
- One trades Eur/Usd using the Envelopes strategy
- One trades Eur/Usd using the Keltner Channel

The way the second BOT is set up allows the user to trade live with an OANDA account. I run some backtesting and this is also the more profitable BOT between the two.
